# TCC-ShortestPath

This doc describe how did make a prototype (academic work) in C# for shortest path finder, comparing two Shortest Path Algorithm:

[Algorithms Graph Theory based]

- Floyd-Warshall (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm)
- Dijkstra (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
- Graph theory (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory)

*Academic Work of engineering degree*

Computing Engineering
Institution: UNISANTA (Santa Cecília Univesity)
City: Santos
State: São Paulo
Country: Brazil

The purpose is compare two algorithm for show the which one is better on these cases:

- Graph with many edges
- Ghaph with many edges crossing points

The data usage in prototype software:

- Amount the path
- Amount the edges crossing points
